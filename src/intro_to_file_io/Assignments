Study the examples in IntroToFileIO.java. Ask your teacher for any clarification you may need.

1. Write a program that takes a message from the user and saves an encrypted form of that message in a new file. Use any encryption algorithm you choose.

2. Create a separate program that asks for a encrypted file (you can use the JFileChooser) and prints the decrypted version.

3. Create a program that adds a copyright notice to all the .java files in your Level 3 repositories (e.g. //Copyright Â© 2017 by Bill Jobs)
   It is highly recommend that you test your program thoroughly with junk files before running it on your actual work.
   
4. Make a to-do list tracker:
	Create a window with four buttons: add task, remove task, save, and load.
	The add task button will display a JOptionPane to get a task from the user and add it to the list.
	Remove task will remove a task from the list. You can choose your own method of how to select a task from the list.
	The save button will save the current task list to a file.
	The load button will load a new task list into the program and display it.
	The program should automatically load the last saved list from the file at startup and display it.
